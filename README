Description
------------
Go language implementation of selected algorithms from the 
"Algorithms in a Nutshell" book. The source code attempts to follow,
as closely as possible, the algorithm pseudocode from the book.


Building/Installing/Testing
---------------------------

    $ make [all|clean|install|test|build]

    all   : calls clean, install, and test
    build : compiles but doesn't install
